## Plugins
### [WPShowPosts](https://en-au.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-show-posts/)
This plugin is used to display posts on different pages on a site. We used this plugin as a way of showing related posts on specific pages, to turn ordinary WordPress pages into category pages.

### [JotForm](https://en-au.wordpress.org/plugins/jotform-oembed/)
This plugin is used to display forms on WordPress pages. A form can be generated at [www.jotform.com](https://www.jotform.com/) and then linked to this plugin to be displayed on the desired page. We used this plugin to display a signup form on our members page.

### [Show Current Template](https://en-au.wordpress.org/plugins/show-current-template/)
This plugin is used to help developers during the development of WordPress themes. It shows what template is currently being used, as well as other template files that are included on the current page being used.

### [WP Google Map](https://srmilon.info/?utm_source=wp-plugins&utm_campaign=author-uri&utm_medium=wp-dash)
This plugin is used to display a location on an embedded Google Maps element. We used this plugin to indicate the location of where the Jazz Club regularly plays.

## Adding new content
The site uses a combination of pages and posts, in order to display and organise content. When adding multiple pieces of content that all share a common category or theme, consider using a single page as a category page, listing multiple posts (such as our History page). This can be done with the [WPShowPosts](https://en-au.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-show-posts/) plugin.  
When adding single page content, then a new single page is appropriate.
