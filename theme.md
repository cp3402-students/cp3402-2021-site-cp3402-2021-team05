# Theme
This custom theme was based off of the starter underscores theme.

## Fonts
The fonts used in the theme can be found in the functions.php file. The body uses PT Serif and the headings use Source Sans Pro as well as some custom heading sizes.
- To change the fonts of the theme, go to the functions.php file and find the `wp_enqueue_style(jazzclub-fonts)`, change the link there with another google fonts link to the new desired fonts.
